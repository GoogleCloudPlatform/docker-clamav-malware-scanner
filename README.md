# Malware Scanner Service

This repository contains the code to build a pipeline that scans objects
uploaded to GCS for malware, moving the documents to a clean or quarantined
bucket depending on the malware scan status. 

This project was forked from [GoogleCloudPlatform/docker-clamav-malware-scanner][gcp-malware]
in order to use Cloud Pub/Sub in place of Eventarc, as well as add Nuvalence-specific
configurations.

## Overview

## Requirements

* 3 GCS buckets for `unscanned`, `scanned`, and `quarantined` files.
* Pub/Sub topic + pull subscription for notifying workers of uploaded files
* GCS upload notification for publishing messages to Pub/Sub
	* `gsutil notification create -t my-upload-topic -e OBJECT_FINALIZE -f json gs://my-unscanned-bucket`
* GKE Cluster
* Google Artifacts Registry (Docker) Repository - `application` in the below example

## Deployment

1. build and push images in `images/` directory

```sh
PROJECT=my-project
REGION=us-east4
GAR_REPO=application
for i in $(ls images); do
	docker build -t $REGION-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT/$GAR_REPO/$i -f images/$i/Dockerfile images/$i
	dockcr push $REGION-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT/$GAR_REPO/$i
done
```

2. deploy to GKE with Helm

Use default values:
```sh
helm upgrade --install my-clamav chart -n [namespace]
```

**OR** Create a `values.yaml` with appropriate values:

```yaml
name: clamav-malware-scanner
environment: "dev"
replicaCount: 1

gcp:
  project: my-project
  region: us-east4
  gar:
    repo: application
worker:
  env:
    UNSCANNED_BUCKET: my-bucket-unscanned
    CLEAN_BUCKET: my-bucket-scanned
    QUARANTINED_BUCKET: my-bucket-quarantined
    UPLOAD_TOPIC: projects/my-project/topics/my-topic
    CLAMD_HOST: 127.0.0.1
    CLAMD_PORT: 3310
```

```
PROJECT=my-project
REGION=us-east4
gcloud container clusters get-credentials $PROJECT --zone $REGION
helm upgrade -f my-values.yaml --install clamav-scanner chart -n [namespace]
```

## Testing

There are 2 files in `static/samples/`; a `CLEAN` file and an `INFECTED`
file with a fake malware signature. Upload them to the unscanned bucket 
while observing the `node-worker` logs. `eicar-anti-malware-testfile.txt`
should report `INFECTED` and the other should not.

## Changes

* 2019-09-01 Initial version
* 2020-10-05 Fixes for ClamAV OOM
* 2021-10-14 Use Cloud Run and EventArc instead of Cloud Functions/App Engine

    improve logging, and handles files in subdirectories
* 2021-11-08 Add support for scanning multiple buckets, improve error
    handling to prevent infinite retries
* 2021-11-22 Remove requirement for Project Viewer permissions.
* 2022-02-22 Fix node-forge vulnerability.
* 2022-03-01 Support larger file sizes (up to 500MiB)
* 2022-06-07 Fix issue where clamav cannot update itself on container start
* 2022-07-09 Refactor into separate containers for GKE, add clamd env vars
