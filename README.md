# Malware Scanner Service

This repository contains the code to build a pipeline that scans objects
uploaded to GCS for malware, moving the documents to a clean or quarantined
bucket depending on the malware scan status. 

This project was forked from [GoogleCloudPlatform/docker-clamav-malware-scanner][gcp-malware]
in order to use Cloud Pub/Sub in place of Eventarc, as well as add Nuvalence-specific
configurations.
