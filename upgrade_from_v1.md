# Upgrading from v1.x to v2.x

Version 2 has a different way of handling ClamAV updates to avoid issues with
the ClamAV content distribution network.

## Background

ClamAV requires an up to date virus definition database to function, but Cloud
Run containers are stateless. Therefore in V1.x, on container startup, the
freshclam daemon downloads the entire virus definition database from ClamAV's
CDN.

ClamAV updated their CDN to rate limit the downloads by IP address to prevent
excessive use, and as Cloud Run uses a common IP address pool for all egress
connections, v1.x frequently triggered this rate limiting, which then prevented
the download and update of the ClamAV database definitions, and prevented
container startup.

V2.x resolves this issue by maintaining a mirror of the malware database
definitions in Cloud Storage, which is regularly updated using
[cvdupdate](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/cvdupdate) to download only the
difference files. ClamAV's update service, freshclam, then only downloads from
this mirror avoiding issues with the ClamAV CDN

## Differences between v1.x and v2.x

v2.x uses the `config.json` file for passing the bucket configuration -
previously this was only required if multiple unscanned buckets are configured

v2.x requires the following additional services

- An additional Cloud Storage bucket for the ClamAV database mirror
- A Cloud Scheduler job to trigger updating of the Cloud Storage mirror. This
  causes the container to run the [updateCvdMirror.sh](cloudrun-malware-scanner/updateCvdMirror.sh).

## Upgrade instructions

Assuming that you already have a v1.7.0 service installed, perform the
following steps in Cloud Shell to update it to v2.0:

1. Enable the [Cloud Scheduler API](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=cloudscheduler.googleapis.com)
   on your project.

1. Clone, or fetch and checkout the the head of the github repository to get the
   2.0 source files

1. Change to the `cloudrun-malware-scanner` directory:

    ```shell
    cd docker-clamav-malware-scanner/cloudrun-malware-scanner
    ```

1. Set up the following shell variables for your project, replacing
   `MY_PROJECT_ID` with your project ID, and configure gcloud.

    ```shell
    REGION=us-central1
    LOCATION=us
    PROJECT_ID=MY_PROJECT_ID
    SERVICE_NAME=malware-scanner
    SERVICE_ACCOUNT="${SERVICE_NAME}@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
    gcloud config set project "${PROJECT_ID}"
    ```

1. Create a Cloud Storage bucket for your ClamAV database mirror, and grant the
   service account access to this bucket

    ```shell
    gsutil mb -l "${LOCATION}" "gs://cvd-mirror-${PROJECT_ID}"
    gsutil iam ch \
        "serviceAccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT}:objectAdmin" \
        "gs://cvd-mirror-${PROJECT_ID}"
    ```

1. If you do not have a `config.json` file, create one from the template, edit
   it and confirm the names of your buckets:

    ```shell
    sed "s/-bucket-name/-${PROJECT_ID}/" config.json.tmpl > config.json
    nano config.json
    ```

1. Perform an initial population of the ClamAV malware database mirror in
    cloud storage:

    ```shell
    python3 -m venv pyenv
    . pyenv/bin/activate
    pip3 install crcmod cvdupdate
    ./updateCvdMirror.sh "cvd-mirror-${PROJECT_ID}"
    deactivate
    ```

    You can check the contents of the mirror with the command:

    ```shell
    gsutil ls "gs://cvd-mirror-${PROJECT_ID}/cvds"
    ```

    It should contain several `.cvd` files, containing the full malware
    database, several `.cdiff` files containing the daily differential updates,
    and some `.json` files with configuration and state information.

1. Build and deploy the updated service:

    ```shell
    export SERVICE_NAME=malware-scanner
    gcloud beta run deploy "${SERVICE_NAME}" \
      --source . \
      --region "${REGION}" \
      --no-allow-unauthenticated \
      --memory 4Gi \
      --cpu 1 \
      --concurrency 20 \
      --min-instances 1 \
      --max-instances 5 \
      --no-cpu-throttling \
      --cpu-boost \
      --service-account="${SERVICE_ACCOUNT}"
    ```

    The build and deployment takes about 10 minutes. Once complete, you will
    see a message:

    ```text
    Service [malware-scanner] revision [malware-scanner-NNNNN-XXX] has been deployed and is serving 100 percent of traffic.
    Service URL: https://malware-scanner-XXXXXXXX-XX.a.run.app
    ```

    Store the `Service URL` value from the output of the deployment command in
    a shell variable.

    ```sh
    SERVICE_URL="https://malware-scanner-XXXXXXXX-XX.a.run.app"
    ```

1. Create a Cloud Scheduler job that executes an HTTP POST request on the Cloud
   Run service with a command to update the mirror of the malware definitions
   database.

   To avoid having too many clients use the same time slot,
   [ClamAV](https://docs.clamav.net/manual/Usage/Configuration.html#freshclamconf)
   requires that you schedule the job at a random minute between 3 and 57,
   avoiding multiples of 10.

   ```sh
   while : ; do
      # set MINUTE to a random number between 3 and 57
      MINUTE="$((RANDOM%55 + 3))"
      # exit loop if MINUTE is not a multiple of 10
      [[ $((MINUTE % 10)) != 0 ]] && break
   done

   gcloud scheduler jobs create http \
        "${SERVICE_NAME}-mirror-update" \
        --location="${REGION}" \
        --schedule="${MINUTE} */2 * * *" \
        --oidc-service-account-email="${SERVICE_ACCOUNT}" \
        --uri="${SERVICE_URL}" \
        --http-method=post \
        --message-body='{"kind":"schedule#cvd_update"}' \
        --headers="Content-Type=application/json"
   ```

   The `--schedule` command line argument defines when the job will run
   [using the unix-cron string format](/scheduler/docs/configuring/cron-job-schedules).
   The value given indicates that it should run at the specific randomly-generated
   minute every 2 hours.

   This job will only update the ClamAV _mirror_ in Cloud Storage. The
   [ClamAV freshclam daemon](https://docs.clamav.net/manual/Usage/SignatureManagement.html#freshclam)
   in each instance of the Cloud Run job will check the mirror every
   thirty minutes for new definitions, and update the ClamAV daemon.
   You can force this job to run at any time using the command:

   ```sh
   gcloud scheduler jobs run malware-scanner-update --location="${REGION}"
   ```

   The results of this command will only be shown in the detailed logs.

## Viewing detailed logs

1. In the Cloud Console, go to the [Logs Explorer](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/query)
   page.

1. If the **Log fields** filter is not displayed, click the **Log Fields**
   button.

1. In the **Log Fields** filter, click **Cloud Run Revision**

1. In the **Service Name** section of the **Log Fields** filter, click
   **malware-scanner**

You can see the malware definitions mirror update checks from the following log lines:

```text
Starting CVD Mirror update
CVD Mirror update check complete. output: ...
```

If the mirror was updated, there will be an additional line:

```text
CVD Mirror updated: DATETIME daily.cld updated (version: MMMMM ...
```

Freshclam daemon update logs will appear every 30 mins and will show as:

```text
Received signal: wake up
ClamAV update process started at Mon Nov 14 14:29:51 2022
daily.cvd database is up-to-date (version: NNNNN ...
main.cvd database is up-to-date (version: NNNNN ...
bytecode.cvd database is up-to-date (version: NNNNN ...
```

If the database was updated, the log lines will instead show as:

```text
DATETIME -> daily.cld updated (version: MMMMM ...
```
