# The setup script both adds and removes clamav.
# This is so that the clamav prerequisites are installed here
# but the package will actually get installed by bootstrap.sh
# when the container starts.
# This is because a) clamav cannot be installed only when the
# container starts due to some things not working in the container
# runtime, and b) clamav cannote be re-installed or updated when
# the container starts due to some wierdness relating to symlinks
# in the container runtime.
